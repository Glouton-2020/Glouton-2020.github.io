Project Title: Box Invaders

Enemies will come down from the top of the screen in a grid and move left and right until they hit either edge at which point they will move down and move in the opposite direction away from the edge of the screen. The entire grid moves as a unit, so if one enemy hits an edge, they all move down and move in the other direction. The enemies on the bottom of each column occasionally shoot a projectile down towards the player. Each enemy has a rank which has it own graphic and points awarded when killed. The enemies closest to the player a low rank and the ones on top have a high rank. 

The player will be at the bottom of the screen and limited to moving left and right. They can shoot a projectile upwards, being limited to one shot on the screen at a time. If a player shot hits an enemy, the enemy is removed from the grid with a little explosion and the player awarded some points. All the remaining enemies speed up a little bit. When all the enemies have been killed, a new grid of enemies is created, now faster and more likely to shoot, and the player is awarded another ship. 

When an enemy shot hits the player, the ship is destroyed. If there are remaining ships available, play continues with a new ship. Once all the extra ships have been destroyed, the game ends and the top 10 high scores are displayed. The high scores will be saved in the browser so the player can come back and beat their own high scores from previous sessions.
